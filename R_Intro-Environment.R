# == HOW TO WORK WITH THIS FILE ======================================
#
#  Go through this script line by line to read and understand the
#  code. Execute code by typing <cmd><enter>. When nothing is
#  selected, that will execute the current line and move the cursor to
#  the next line. You can also select more than one line, e.g. to
#  execute a block of code, or less than one line, e.g. to execute
#  only the core of a nested expression.
#
#  Edit code, as required, experiment with options, or just play.
#  Especially play.
#
#  DO NOT simply source() this whole file!
#
#  If there are portions you don't understand, use R's help system,
#  Google for an answer, or ask me. Don't continue if you don't
#  understand what's going on. That's not how it works ...
#
#  This is YOUR file. Write your notes in here and add as many
#  comments as you need to understand what's going on here when you
#  come back to it in a year. That's the right way: keep code, data
#  and notes all in one place.

"There are many more functions for ... that this tutorial did not cover. You should know about the following. Look up the function and write a short bit of example code that uses it:"

?subset
?sweep
?with     # ... and within()

"Then you should know about the following packages. Open the vignette and browse through it. You should know be able to come up with least one use-case where the package functions would be useful:
